#' Crosswalk Death Data File Years
#'
#' @description Death Certificate Statistical files changed considerably after the Washington State Department of Health changed collection systems
#' from the Electronic Death Registration System (EDRS) to the Washington Health and Life Event Systems (WHALES). Specifically, the death certificate data
#' is considerably different from 2010-2015 versus 2016-onwards and requires considerable reformatting to preserve longitudinal analysis across these time periods.
